# docker-example

This is going to be a test project to get familiar with setting up projects with docker.

## As a developer

- [x] I first want to set up the project's local git to use the correct account.
- [ ] I want to create a new feature branch from master.
- [ ] I want to simply spin up this docker container and have my application ready to work with.
- [ ] I want to set up some custom hostname via a config file if that is possible.
- [ ] I want to also deploy this on vercel without docker causing issues.
