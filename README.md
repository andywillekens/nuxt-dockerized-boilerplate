# docker-example

This is going to be a test project to get familiar with setting up projects with docker.

## As a developer

- [ ] I first want to set up my github account to use the correct account.
- [ ] I want to simply spin up this docker container and have my application ready to work with
- [ ] want to set up some custom hostname via a config file if that is possible
- [ ] I want to also deploy this on vercel without docker causing issues
